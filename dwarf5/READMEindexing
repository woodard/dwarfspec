---Introduction

We do two sorts of 'index' entries:  indexing and linking.

There are specific commands to do the indexing in Latex, but
we use local commands rather than directly using \index
to save redundant typing and to make future revisions easier.

Where terms are actually defined in the document (as opposed
to simply being referenced) each reference to the term
is made an active link (in pdf terms) to the definition.
Of course the command also indexes the link.

---Indexing

The actual command definitions in dwarf5.tex are:
\newcommand{\addtoindex}[1]{#1\index{#1}}
\newcommand{\addtoindexi}[2]{#1\index{#2}}
\newcommand{\noindex}[1]{#1}

Where a word or phrase is to be indexed.

The \noindex case indicates the word or phrase is to be
inserted as-is, not indexed.   So that readers of the
latex source can know someone considered indexing a word
that looked like it should be indexed
but decided not to index it.   This is mostly necessary
for form-class instances as some form-class words are used
in ordinary English, like 'block'.  When searching a document
for index omissions we will often want to distinguish
new uses from old (and already-considered) instances and
the \noindex command helps us do that.

---Indexing special cases
The special cases are index entries that say 
'See ' instead of a page reference (documented
in latex and called cross-references), entries
that are indexed with a phrase, and entries that are indexed
with a phrase with a comma.
   
(these taken from DWARF4 FIXME use dwarf5 examples)
   address selection        See base address selection
   abstract instance tree
   array, declaration of type
   array, descriptor for

standard case where we index a word as-is.
\addtoindex{document}

This generates the subindex case, the index spelling does not match
what the text must say:
\addtoindexi{array}{array!declaration of type}

This generates an index with See (See can be any phrase, not
just .
The | here is uniquely handled by latex so it is not confused as
a math character.
\addtoindexi{address selection}{address selection|see{base address selection}}




---Linking

The actual command definitions in dwarf5.tex are:
\newcommand{\livelink}[2]{\hyperlink{#1}{#2}\index{#2} }
\newcommand{\livetarg}[2]{\hypertarget{#1}{#2}\index{#2}}
\newcommand{\livetargi}[3]{\hypertarget{#1}{#2}\index{#3}}
\newcommand{\nolink}[1]{#1}

We want terms like DW_TAG_common (which is all the DW_* terms)
to both be indexed and also to be a 'live link' in a pdf to
a definition of the term.  The intent is that clicking
on the word or phrase in the document switches you to
a display of the definition.

Attributes in DWARF may have multiple definition points, so
for example DW_AT_abstract_origin links one to the attribute table
and that in turn links to the 3 distinct definitions.
Other than Attributes though, links are usually directly
to the definition.

The first argument in a livelink/livetarg/livetargi command
is a string that must be unique to the target, it is used
by latex to tie each link to its single target location.

Sentences referencing the form-class words should also be
live links. For common English form-class words 
like 'address' or 'block' there can be many word uses
we do not want to link or index, so \nolink or \noindex
let us designate those instances for folks working with
the latex document source.

The \livetargi instance lets us make the index entry be
a phrase or spelling distinct from the live link word.
