The directory 'latexdoc' contains a work-in-progress
of DWARF5 in latex source.  

See latexdoc/README and tools/README and latexdoc/Makefile
for more information.

The tools directory is intended to help in overall reviews
of the latexdoc files and for special projects involving the
.tex files.  The tools read the .tex source and operate on
that source in various ways.

Editting a .tex file and committing the result does not
require or involve any use of the python or other code in the
tools directory.  Most contributors editting the .tex source
have no need to look at the tools source or use the tools.
