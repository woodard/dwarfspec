On undefined references while building the document: In
early latex passes forward references tend to be reported as
'undefined'.   An example is:

LaTeX Warning: Reference `chap:generaldescription' on page
3 undefined on input line 59.

Because the side-files latex generates help resolve those in
later passes the simple existence of 'undefined' in a 'make'
on a 'clean' directory should not be alarming as these will
usually be from an early pass.  Run a second 'make' without
doing a 'make clean' (thus using the side-files from the first
'make') and if all is well the second 'make' will not generate
any messages about 'undefined'.

On Linux:
On modern linux, here is the set of steps to build a pdf.
While pdflatex might seem simpler to use (than the following)
it will not correctly generate a pdf as complex as this one.

        latex dwarf5.tex
        latex dwarf5.tex
        makeindex dwarf5
        latex dwarf5.tex
        latex dwarf5.tex
        dvips dwarf5.dvi -o dwarf5.ps
        ps2pdf dwarf5.ps dwarf5.pdf

The DWARF5 latex document was first added here May 10, 2012.
The plan is to achieve a complete (insofar as is possible)
identical-to-DWARF4 document (which is referred to as DWARF
4.1).  Mark that with a git tag.   Then proceed to change
the document with DWARF5 changes.
