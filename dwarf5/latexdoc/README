On modern linux, here is the set of steps to build a pdf.
While pdflatex might seem simpler to use (than the following)
it will not correctly generate a pdf as complex as this one.

        latex dwarf5.tex
        latex dwarf5.tex
        makeindex dwarf5
        latex dwarf5.tex
        latex dwarf5.tex
        dvips dwarf5.dvi -o dwarf5.ps
        ps2pdf dwarf5.ps dwarf5.pdf

The DWARF5 latex document was first added here May 10, 2012.
The tentative plan is to achieve a complete
(insofar as is possible) identical-to-DWARF4 document.
Mark that with a git tag.   Then proceed to change the document
with DWARF5 changes.
