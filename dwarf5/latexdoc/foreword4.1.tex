This version of the DWARF Debugging Information Format is first and foremost 
a re-implementation of the Version 4 document using the \LaTeX\  
document preparation system.
There are no substantive changes compared to the Version 4 document.
The main presentational change is to convert many figures to proper
tables and to present programming language source and DWARF listings
in a boxed format.
Otherwise there are very few even minor editorial changes (other than
those sometimes mandated by the underlying technology).

If any substantive descrepancies are discovered between these two documents,
please bring them to the attention of the DWARF Information Format Committee.
