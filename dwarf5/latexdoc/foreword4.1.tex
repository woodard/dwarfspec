This version of the DWARF Debugging Information Format is first and foremost 
a re-implementation of the Version 4 document using the \LaTeX document preparation system.
There are no substantive changes compared to the Version 4 document and very few even minor
editorial changes other than those mandated by the underlying technology.

If any descrepencies are discovered between these two documents, please bring them to the
attention of the DWARF Information Format Committee.
