On undefined references while building the document: In
early latex passes forward references tend to be reported as
'undefined'.   An example is:

LaTeX Warning: Reference `chap:generaldescription' on page
3 undefined on input line 59.

Because the side-files latex generates help resolve those in
later passes the simple existence of 'undefined' in a 'make'
on a 'clean' directory should not be alarming as these will
usually be from an early pass.  Run a second 'make' without
doing a 'make clean' (thus using the side-files from the first
'make') and if all is well the second 'make' will not generate
any messages about 'undefined'.

On Linux:
On modern linux, here is the set of steps to build a pdf.
While pdflatex might seem simpler to use (than the following)
it will not correctly generate a pdf as complex as this one.

        latex dwarf5.tex
        latex dwarf5.tex
        makeindex dwarf5
        latex dwarf5.tex
        latex dwarf5.tex
        dvips dwarf5.dvi -o dwarf5.ps
        ps2pdf dwarf5.ps dwarf5.pdf



On Windows:
This Editor has used TeXworks on Windows successfully.
The About TeXworks tab describes it as "a simple
environment for edititing, typesetting and previewing
TeX documents". It is based on MiKTeX, which is Open
Source (and free). See
    http://www.tug.org/texworks/
and/or
    http://code.google.com/p/texworks/downloads/list
for full details. It is supported on Windows XP/Vista/7
and installed easily.

TeXworks presents two windows--one for editing and one
for viewing the final .pdf. The DWARF document build is 
fast enough to use TeXworks as an "almost WYSIWYG" 
environment.


On Mac OS X:
Install the MacTeX distribution from http://www.tug.org/mactex/ 
All of the necessary tools will be installed in a directory like
/usr/local/texlive/2012/bin/x86_64-darwin/

The same instructions for Linux will now work.


============================

The DWARF5 latex document was first added here May 10, 2012.
The plan is to achieve a complete (insofar as is possible)
identical-to-DWARF4 document (which is referred to as DWARF
4.1).  Mark that with a git tag.   Then proceed to change
the document with DWARF5 changes.

============================

A limitation of LaTex is that it does not handle multipage
figures at all (they just run off the bottom of the page).
It appears the best that can be done is to split figures
"by hand" into multiple figures. Advise on how to do this
was found at

www.staff.science.uu.nl/~oostr102/floats/node4.html#SECTION00022000000000000000

and included here:

"There isn't an equivalent longfigure solution, so for figures
you will usually have to split it yourself. In general this is 
less of a problem. However, the problem you get now is how to 
keep them together, i.e. how to get the parts on subsequent 
pages, and how to get a single entry in the list of figures.

"You will have to split the figure into pieces and put each part 
in a separate figure environment. To keep them together it is 
best to use only the [p] placement, so that they will be put on 
floatpages. As they are bigger than a page this is appropriate. 
The first part would then get a \caption, the subsequent parts 
would be used without a caption. If you want to add a caption-
like text, enter it as normal text rather than a \caption, so 
that it will not be entered in the list of figures. It may also 
be desirable to issue a \clearpage first, just like we did for 
the longtable, and to encapsulate this in the \afterpage command. 
E.g.

\afterpage{\clearpage\input{myfigure}}

where myfigure.tex contains:

\begin{figure}[p]
\includegraphics{myfig1.eps}
\caption{This is a multipage figure}
\label{fig:xxx}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[p]
\includegraphics{myfig2.eps}
\begin{center}
Figure~\ref{fig:xxx} (continued)
\end{center}
\end{figure}

"You have to make sure that the last part is big enough, otherwise 
LaTeX could decide to postpone it until it has collected some more 
floats. This can be done either by making the figure big enough 
(e.g. by adding some \vspace), or by tweaking the \floatpagefraction 
floatpagefraction parameter.

"If you want your multipage figure to start at a lefthand-side (even-
numbered) page you can use a test in the \afterpage command (using 
the ifthen package):

\afterpage{\clearpage
\ifthenelse{\isodd{\value{page}}{\afterpage{\input{myfigure}}} % odd page
    {\input{myfigure}}}} % even page

"If there are too many floats on the skipped page, this may still fail 
to start your multipage figure on an even page, however."

This is basically the strategy used in the DWARF V4.1 and later documents.
See especially Appendices D (Examples) and E (Compresion) for numerous
examples.
